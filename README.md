## FAQ

**Q:** I see a warning on Windows, I don't trust the executable, etc.

**A:** I wonâ€™t pay for a certificate for my side projects (~400$/y). You can always install the app on a VM and unpack it using Asar (or build it yourself). The app is not locked, and even the DevTools is available (CTRL + SHIFT + I).

PLEASE DOUBLE CHECK IF THE PORT YOU'LL USE IS NOT OPEN ON PUBLIC NETWORK.

A quick way to verify is to start the server (RUN button), connect using my_public_ip:my_port. If you can access the pad, it means the port is publicly open.
